                <p> I have always been an aspiring software engineer, and here are some of the amazing experiences I have had in the field! </p>
                
                <h4>Facebook</h4>
                <p>Because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, my software engineering internship at Facebook for the summer of 2020, which would 
                    have been hosted in Menlo Park, is now remote. 
                </p>

                <h4>Google</h4>
                <p> As an Engineering Practicum intern, I worked on the Shasta team within Google Ads in the Sunnyvale, CA
                    office during the summer of 2019. My team worked on writing a learning algorithm to reduce cache misses when advertisement requests were queried. 
                </p>

                <h4>Vistaprint</h4>
                <p>After my freshmen year of university in the summer of 2018, I worked at Vistaprint in Waltham, MA as a software engineering intern. 
                    I worked on the Hatchery team to create a Facebook messenger bot that customers can use to build customizable phone cases. 
                </p>

                <h4>Boston University</h4>
                <p>In the summer of 2016, I worked within a Human-Computer Interaction research group at Boston University to 
                    create an adaptable email interface for users with disabilities using the Gmail API. </p>

                <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
                <p> I am lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to TA for classes that have very much shaped my computer 
                    science education at University. So far, I have been a teaching assistant for Introduction to Computer Systems and both a
                    teaching assistant and head teaching assistant for Introduction to Software Engineering.
